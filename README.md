# AlekFull Solo Horizontal - Xargon's Edition
My edition of the default RG351P Emulationstation/EmuELEC theme.

Added fetures:

*Gamelist style Video:*
- Reduced game title size
- Increased video size
- Added game info under the video: Name, Rating, Release date

*TODO:*
- Add the clock
- Add the battery percentage
- Improve the gamelist
- Clean some system images

*How to install:*
- Download the theme by pressing the green code button on the upper right corner of this page and pressing Download ZIP button.
- Extract the theme
- Place the extracted fonder into your RG351P folder: /storage/.config/emulationstation/themes
- Check that the folder you've placed is named AlekFull-Solo-Horizontal-Xargons-ED and contains all the folders and the theme.xml, so the full patch will be: /storage/.config/emulationstation/themes/AlekFull-Solo-Horizontal-Xargons-ED/theme.xml

*How to apply the theme:*
- When on the system list press START
- Navigate to UI Settings
- Navigate to Theme Set
- Select AlekFull-Solo-Horizontal-Xargons-ED
- To see my edits set the Gamelist View Style as "Video"
- Enjoy.
